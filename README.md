# Python DSA Repository

Welcome to the **Python DSA Repository**! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains solutions to various coding problems related to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in **Python**. It includes problem-solving approaches and assignments from different online platforms and courses aimed at enhancing my skills in data science and software development.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
* **Assignments**: Contains Python DSA problem assignments completed as part of my online courses and skill enhancement programs.
* **Platform Problem Solutions**: Solutions to coding problems from different competitive programming platforms like:
  * **LeetCode**
  * **HackerRank**
  * **GeeksforGeeks**
  * **Others** (as applicable)

## Topics Covered

* **Arrays**
* **Linked Lists**
* **Stacks & Queues**
* **Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees**
* **Dynamic Programming**
* **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**
* **Graph Algorithms**
* **Recursion**
* **Hashing**
* **Greedy Algorithms**
* **Backtracking**
* **Other core DSA concepts**

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the folders and explore the solutions. Each problem/assignment contains:
* The problem statement
* Approach/Explanation of the solution
* Python code implementation

## Future Plans

I will keep updating this repository as I complete more assignments and solve problems on different platforms to further enhance my DSA and Python skills.
